# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze four months of ride share data from three different city types to determine which city types are generating the most revenue and which may need more driver support.

## Resources

    Software
    Python 3.7
    Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
    Pandas 1.1.3
    matplotlib 3.3.2

##  Summary

After reviewing the data the total rides, number of drivers, and total fares are highest in the urban cities. However, the data also shows that the Average fare per ride and per driver are highest in rural cities.

1. Total Rides 

Rural        125
Suburban     625
Urban       1625

2. Total Drivers

Rural         78
Suburban     490
Urban       2405

3. Total Fares

Rural        $4327.93
Suburban    $19,356.33
Urban       $39,854.38

4. Average Fare per Ride

Rural       $34.62
Suburban    $30.97
Urban       $24.53

5. Average Fare per Driver

Rural       $55.49
Suburban    $39.50
Urban       $16.57
   
6. Total Fare by City Type per week

## Recommendations
https://github.com/mcginav/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig5.png 
The data shows that the Urban cities made up more than 62% of the revenue in the four month period. More resources should be spent in Rural and Suburban cities to increase the number of rides in those cities. I would recommend collecting more data for the Rural and Suburban cities including the length of trips and the amount of wait time for the ride. The average ride fare is higher in the rural and suburban cities. Does that mean the trip lengths are longer? Drivers also make more per trip in those cities. Would increasing the number of drivers increase the number of trips taken? I would recommend creating incentives to riders in the Rural and Suburban cities to try to increase the number of rides in those areas. I would also recommend recruiting more drivers in the Rural and Suburban cities to have more accessibility to riders.
